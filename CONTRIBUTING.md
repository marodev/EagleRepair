## What do I need to know to help?

We do all our development [on GitHub](https://github.com/marodev/EagleRepair).

Prerequisites to develop:
- .NET 5 SDK

## Building sources

Open the solution file `EagleRepair.sln` with your favorite IDE (e.g., Rider, Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code)
and build the solution.

Alternatively, the sources can be build from the command line:

```
dotnet build
```

Run tests
```
dotnet test
```
